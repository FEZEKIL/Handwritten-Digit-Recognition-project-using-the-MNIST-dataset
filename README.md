3. Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

Skills: Neural Networks, Keras, TensorFlow

Dataset: MNIST Digits Dataset

What you’ll do:

Build a feedforward neural network to classify digits (0–9).

Evaluate accuracy and visualize misclassified digits.
Outcome: Your first Deep Learning model — very common interview project.

This complete MNIST digit recognition project will:

Load and explore the famous MNIST dataset

Preprocess data properly (normalization, reshaping, one-hot encoding)

Build a neural network with multiple dense layers and dropout

Train with callbacks (early stopping, learning rate scheduling)

Evaluate comprehensively with accuracy, loss, confusion matrix

Visualize results including misclassified digits

Provide business insights and model interpretation

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Neural network architecture design

Data preprocessing for deep learning

Model training and validation

Performance evaluation and visualization

Overfitting prevention with dropout and callbacks

Interpretation of model results

Run each cell sequentially in Google Colab - this will create an impressive deep learning project for your portfolio!
